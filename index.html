                            <p>
                                My name is Marcus "Bitsauce" Loo Vergara, and I am a computer science nerd.
                                I am currently attening my last semester of a 6 year long MSc degree in computer
                                science from
                                the Norwegian University of Science and Technology.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Already in elementary school, I had a facination for all things computer and
                                technology.
                                Growing up in the era when 3D graphics just hit the home consoles, I gained initial
                                interest in learning about these technologies.
                                Determined to achieve my goal, I started to learn how to program at the age of 13
                                with the help of Torque game eninge.

                            <h3>Games & Graphics</h3>
                            <p>
                                My journey in programming started by the desire to create experiences that
                                I would enjoy myself, and that I could share with other people.
                                Along the way I got an interest for the more technological side of games,
                                in particular real-time 3D graphics. Struck with a desire to understand
                                graphics on a more fundamental level, I sought to create a simple
                                game engine with C++ and OpenGL. The ultimate goal would be to create a 2D game
                                with this engine.
                            </p>

                            <h4>Overworld</h4>
                            <p>
                                Overworld is the most comprehensive of these projects – an infinite,
                                tile-based sandbox akin to Terraria and Minecraft. The project has
                                been in development since November 2011, however its development
                                has been put on ice due to focus on the Master's thesis.
                                I have learned a lot
                                about optimization for games, and how to ensure efficient communication
                                between the GPU and CPU through the project. Maintaining a stable
                                frame rate when generation has to happen on the fly is difficult,
                                and lead me to utilize the GPU for general purpose computing to
                                ease the load on the CPU.

                            <p>
                                During the summer of 2018 I got an amazing opportunity – to
                                join PlayStation's Global Developer Technology Group, and work on
                                various projects related to PS4 graphics. One of these projects
                                pertained to the implementation of Physically Based Shading.
                                I learned a lot about topics in advanced 3D graphics:
                                HDR lighting, the "metallic workflow," GPU architecture, etc.

                            <h3>Machine Learning & Master's Thesis</h3>
                            <p>
                                There has been a lot of interest in artificial intelligence as of late,
                                and I view these technologies with curiousity and fascination. These
                                technologies have potential. My degree is in <i>visual compution</i>,
                                where computer vision held a significant role. As such, I have taken
                                several courses and done multiple replication studies as class projects.
                                As with graphics, I wanted to understand deep learning on the most
                                fundamental level, and therefore opt to implement papers from scratch,
                                and with modifications that I deem worthy of experimentation.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                For my thesis, I ended up delving into the topic of deep reinforcement learning
                                for self-driving vehicles. So far, I implemented the state-of-the-art method
                                in reinforcement learning, known as Proximal Policy Optimization.
