                            <p>
                                My name is Marcus "Bitsauce" Vergara, and I am a software engineer
                                who's main areas of interests include computer graphics, computer vision, and deep learning.
                                I graduated from the Norwegian University of Science and Technology with a M.Sc. degree
                                in computer science June 2019. I love to dive deep into topics in these areas, and always
                                aim to learn and explore new ideas in the field.

                            <h3>Graphics & Games</h3>
                            <p>
                                Growing up in the era when 3D graphics had just hit the home consoles,
                                I developed an interest in learning how these experiences were made.
                                I sought out information on the internet and scoured the forums,
                                and eventually ended up with a copy of the Torque Game Engine installed on my machine.
                                I didn't know programming, 3D modeling, audio design, or anything really, but I was persistent.
                                I learned to program in C++ by carefully reading the source code of the engine
                                and sample projects, and making connections between what happened in-game with the code on screen.
                            </p>

                            <h4>Fractala</h4>
                            <p>
                                Fractala Sandbox is the most comprehensive of these projects â€“ a 2D physics
                                sandbox game which can simulate hundreds of thousands of particles
                                in real-time by utilizing the GPU for simulation.
                                The project has been in development since 2019,
                                and, in creating the engine from scratch,
                                I have learned a lot about optimization for games
                                and ways to ensure efficient communication between the GPU and CPU.

                            <p>
                                During the summer of 2018, I got an amazing opportunity to
                                join PlayStation's Global Developer Technology Group as an intern
                                and to work on various projects related to PS4 graphics.
                                One of these projects pertained to the implementation of
                                physically based rendering methods, in particular the "metallic workflow."
                                I learned a lot about topics in advanced 3D graphics, such as
                                low-level graphics programming, HDR and 4K rendering,
                                GPU architectures and performance analysis.
