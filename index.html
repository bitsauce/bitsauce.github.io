                                Like many, I developed a fascination for all
                                things computer and technology in my youth.
                                At the age of 13, I set it as my goal to learn
                                as much as possible about the technologies that drive my
                                favorite gadgets and experiences,
                                with the motivation of one day using that knowledge to
                                create captivating and meaningful experiences for myself and
                                the people around me.

                                My name is Marcus "Bitsauce" Loo Vergara, and I am a student
                                at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology,
                                attending my last semester of a 6-year long degree to become
                                an M.Sc in computer science.
                                My main areas of study and interests are computer graphics

                    <p>
                        and deep learning.
                        I love to dive deep into topics in these subjects and experiment on the state-of-the-art,
                        and examples of projects where I have done this include
                        creating interactive soft shadows with ray-tracing,
                        learning about reinforcement learning and understanding the math behind policy gradient,
                        and writing a physically based shading renderer.
                        I also enjoy following developments at conferences such as
                        SIGGRAPH, CVPR, GDC, and I would, of course, love to have opportunities to attend these
                        conferences in the future.

                    <p>
                        A central part of my personality is my desire to explore the world, and studying at
                        the University of California, San Diego for a full year is evidence of this.
                        Getting into UCSD was one of the biggest milestones in my life, and it opened
                        up many great opportunities for me. I definitely see myself living internationally
                        and working in an international setting.

                            <h3>Graphics & Games</h3>
                            <p>
                                Growing up in the era when 3D graphics had just hit the home consoles,
                                I developed an interest in learning how to create these experiences.
                                I sought out information on the internet and scoured the forums,
                                and eventually ended up with a copy of the Torque Game Engine in front of me.
                                I didn't know programming nor 3D modeling, but I had persistence on my side.
                                I learned to program in C++ by meticulously analyzing the source code of the engine,
                                and making connections between what happened in-game with the code on my screen.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Along the way, I became more interested in the technological side of games,
                                in particular, how real-time 3D graphics are realized.
                                Struck with a desire to understand graphics, I sought to create a simple
                                game engine with C++ and OpenGL, where the ultimate goal would be to create
                                a fully-fledged 2D game with this engine.
                            </p>

                            <h4>Overworld</h4>
                            <p>
                                Overworld is the most comprehensive of these projects – an infinite,
                                tile-based sandbox akin to Terraria and Minecraft. The project has
                                been in development since November 2011, however, its development
                                has been put on hold due more of my focus being directed towards
                                the Master's thesis.
                                I have learned a lot about optimization for games,
                                and how to ensure efficient communication
                                between the GPU and CPU through the project. Maintaining a stable
                                frame rate when generation has to happen on the fly is difficult,
                                and lead me to utilize the GPU for general purpose computing to
                                ease the load on the CPU.

                            <p>
                                During the summer of 2018, I got an amazing opportunity to
                                join PlayStation's Global Developer Technology Group as an intern
                                and to work on various projects related to PS4 graphics.
                                One of these projects pertained to the implementation of
                                physically based rendering methods, in particular the "metallic workflow."
                                I learned a lot about topics in advanced 3D graphics, such as
                                low-level graphics programming, HDR and 4K rendering,
                                GPU architectures and performance analysis.

                            <p>
                                Machine learning has been a hot topic as of late, as we have
                                seen deep learning achieve state-of-the-art results on tasks
                                that were thought to be hard or intractable.
                                I view deep learning through a curious lense and have taken
                                it upon myself to learn how this technology works. I strongly
                                believe that machine learning technologies have a lot of potential
                                in computer vision, natural language processing, and even
                                computer graphics, and I believe we are only going to see more
                                and more methods utilize machine learning in some facet or another
                                in vision and graphics.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Eager to explore a frontier of technology that promises to change society
                                as we know it, I joined the autonomous vehicle lab for my final two semesters at NTNU.
                                In accordance with my supervisor, I determined my role in the team would be to explore
                                reinforcement learning – a sub-field of machine learning that focuses on creating agents
                                that act in a way that maximizes its utility with respect to a predetermined goal.
                                The prospect of creating artificial intelligence that can learn to drive and play games
                                by trial-and-error is fascinating to me, and is also a project that allows me to combine
                                my experience with game engines and computer vision since reinforcement learning for
                                autonomous vehicles typically use driving simulators such as CARLA or AirSim,
                                both of which are simulators that run on Unreal Engine 4.
